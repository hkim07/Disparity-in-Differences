# Disparity-in-Differences
A manuscript introducing this method is available at arXiv.

## Getting Started
All core functions and implementations are in the Python script "dispindiffs.py". Especially, this script relies on the Python package "polars" for fast operations on data frames. 
```python
elist = pl.read_csv(FILE)
```
